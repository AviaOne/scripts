# BLOCKCHAIN UPGRADE TIME ESTIMATOR<br>by AviaOne.com 
This script is working perfectly with all blockchains from Cosmos Ecosytem, we did not test it from others ecosystems...

## We took the AtomOne mainnet as an example to go up to block 5,000,000 and compared our script with Mintscan and Ping.pub explorer.


|   EXPLORER                  |        date             |         Estimated Time        |         Difference with our script        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
Our script | 8 days 20 hours 23 minutes 49 seconds | 18 Sep 2025 22:34:14 | __________ 
Mintscan| 8 days 20 hours 33 minutes 18 seconds| 18 Sep 2025 22:42:09 | 9 minutes, 29 secondes 
Ping.pub| 9 days 2 hours 28 minutes 43 seconds | 19 Sep 2025 06:51:52 | <b>6 heures</b>, 4 minutes et 54 secondes 

## ping.pub has +6 hours extra compared to our script and Mintscan !
Screenshots are available below to help you clear up any doubts!
