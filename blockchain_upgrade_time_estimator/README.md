# BLOCKCHAIN UPGRADE TIME ESTIMATOR<br>by AviaOne.com 
This script is working perfectly with all blockchains from Cosmos Ecosytem, we did not test it from others ecosystems...
## Some explorers estimate the block time with a fixed value of 10,000 blocks per 24 hours.. 
(Ping.pub explorer works like this, correct me if I'm wrong...) so the estimated time to calculate an upgrade is somewhat wrong for this reason...

## This script will dynamically estimate the number of blocks produced every 24 hours and provide a more accurate time estimate with this method.

|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Average block time  | 5.685 seconds<br>(calculated over 15,197 blocks) | 5.9 seconds<br>(fixed, assumed over 10,000 blocks)     |
| Estimated total time| 568,500 seconds<br>= 6 days 13 hours 35 min| 590,000 seconds<br>= 6 days 19 hours 26 min             |

###  We compared it with the AtomOne blockchain and calculated the time required to produce 100,000 blocks.
### The difference is enormous over 100,000 blocks!
### Using a static method of 10,000 blocks every 24 hours, the inaccuracy compared to our script is 5 hours and 51 minutes.

# How to use this script to estimate time dynamically?
## Install this script inside your server.
Create the folder.
```sh
mkdir -p $HOME/scripts/blockchain_upgrade_time_estimator/
```
Install the script inside the folder.
```sh
wget -O calcutate_update_time_blocks.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aviaone/scripts/main/blockchain_upgrade_time_estimator/calcutate_update_time_blocks.sh
```

## Give the permission to your file.
```sh
chmod +x /calcutate_update_time_blocks.sh
```

## Now test it :rocket:
```sh
calcutate_update_time_blocks.sh
```
## You will see this result :
